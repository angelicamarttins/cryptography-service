# Overview
This service allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages and provides CRUD operations to manage encrypted data. The project was created based on the backend-br challenge and serves as an example of how to implement cryptography features in a RESTful API.

The project was based in a [backend-br challenge](https://github.com/backend-br/desafios/blob/master/cryptography/PROBLEM.md).

# Features
- Encryption: Accepts a plaintext message and converts it into an encrypted message.
- Decryption: Reverses the encryption process, converting an encrypted message back to its original plaintext.
- CRUD Operations: Allows creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of cryptography-related records.
- RESTful API: Provides documented endpoints for interacting with the service.
